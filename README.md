# streamfly

Streamfly aims to be a stream-oriented Pub/Sub framework.

Unlike traditional Pub/Sub systems, instead of transffering data packets(messages), streamfly focuses on transffering streams, which means users could publish or subscrbie a stream(Reader & Writer). Then developers can manipulate these streams in their applications, just like the stdin & stdout.
